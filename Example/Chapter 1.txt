1.1 _- Introduction
Statistics is one of the most important branches of applied mathematics. It is
used in fields like agriculture, physical sciences and human sciences.
Descriptive statistics is mainly concerned with summary calculations and
graphical displays of data.
In this module we will study the description of data obtained from samples.

1.2 Definitions

1.2.1 Population / Sample
A population is the total set of elements of interest for a given problem. A
sample is. a subset of a population. In later studies we use statistics obtained
from samples to make predictions for the population the sample came from. This
is called Statistical Inference.

1.2.2 The statistic

A statistic is a function of the samplédata. Examples of a statistic are the
arithmetic mean, mode, median and standard deviation. These will be defined
in the following sections. ‘

1.2.3 Arithmetic mean
The arithmetic mean is the sum of all the data divided by the number of
observations. Thus if X,, X,, .... X, are n observations, then we write the
arithmetic mean as follows:

Aq +X +... +X,

n
X

A}

X =The Greek capital letter £ (Sigma) is used to indicate the sum of a number of elements.
The subscript i in formula (1.1) is a discrete variable which assumes the values 1, then
2, 3,... up to the last observation n. We will often use this notation.

1.2.4 The mode
The mode is the most frequently occurring value. If it is important to know which

observation occurred most often, the mode is determined.

1.2.5 The median
The median is the middle value when the data are arranged in numerical

sequence. Fifty percent of the observations are greater than the median and
50% are less. tor ‘

1.3 - Measures of deviation _
All the previous statistics, the mean, mode and median are measures of central

tendency, i.e. a number which tries to indicate a "central" value in a set of data.
Statistics which describe the spread or variation of data are called measures of

deviation or dispersion.

1.3.1 The range
The range is the simplest statistic which gives a indication of the spread of a set

of numbers. It is simply equal to the difference between the lowest and highest
value in a sample. The range has the serious disadvantage in that it only uses
the extreme two values of the sample and ignores the information contained in
the rest of the sample. The following statistics overcome this problem.

1.3.2 The variance
If we add all the squared differences between each sample value and the

sample mean and divide this quantity by (n -1), we obtain the variance:

(X, X) +(X,-X)+... +(X, -X»

S2=
n-1

 

And if we use the >. notation:

n-~1

The standard deviation S is the square root of the variance:1.3.3 Example

1.4

Consider the following data set:

X, 24 13, 18, 35, 5, 28, 31,“ 24, 29

The méan: - {
__E X,

24+13+ +29

9
= 23

_ The mode: the number 24 occurs twice, hence this is the mode.

The median: first arrange the data set in ascending order: 
A, : 5, 13, 18, 24, 24, 28, 29, 31, 35
{

Hence the median is 24.

Note: if the set of data has an even number of elements we obtain the median
by computing the mean of the two middle numbers.

The standard deviation:

5 - I X (Xx Y
n~-1

+... }

rnm
s

9-1
= 9,49
Remarks:
(1) _ The mode and median are equal in this case, but this is in general not
true.

(2) - Another data set Y might have a equal mean but a smaller or greater
standard deviation, depending on the variation in the data set.

Grouped data

When summarizing large masses of raw data, it is often useful to distribute the
data into classes or categories. The number of individuals belonging to each
class is determined, and this is called the class frequency. A tabular
arrangement of data by classes together with the corresponding class frequency
is called a frequency distribution or frequency table. Table 1.1 is a sample of
60 determinations of the copper content of a standard solution.Table 1.1

These observations were made to an accuracy of 3 significant numbers and to
1 decimal place. To obtain a good overall impression of such a large data set,

it is necessary to group the data in a frequency distribution.

- Table 1.2 _ COPPER DETERMINATIONS

Classes Class Mark Frequency Cumulative copper conc. Frequenc

   
   

       

1 4.1 Classes
The left column contains the class intervals. In setting up the class intervals we

must consider:

(1) _ The number of classes
As a guide Sturge's Rule can be used:

K=1+(3,3 Log n)

_ Where - K=the number of classes
n=the sample size
in this example the number of classes is given by:

K=1 +(3,3 Logn)
=1 +3,3L0g60) °=6,87 =7(2)

(3) 
Class size
The class size is obtained by dividing the Range (highest - lowest number in

- data) by the number of classes obtained above. In this example the range is

equal to 66,3 - 54,4 =11,9 we find the class size to be 11,977 =1,7. For practical

- reasons this is rounded to the nearest whole number. In this example we will
- have a class width of 2 ppm.

Class limits | .
Since 54,4 was the lowest determination, we take our first class within the limits

54,0 and 55,9 (see table 1.2). The next class starts with a lower limit of 56,0 and

~~~ ends with a higher limit of 57,9. This is continued until the highest determination

-@

(8)

(6)

falls in the last class.

The class boundaries _- , | e

The lower class boundary and upper class boundary of the first class will be
53,95 and 55,95 respectively. This gives us a class ppm size of 2 ppm. Since
the copper determinations were accurate to one decimal place we calculate the
class boundaries to two decimal places. This will prevent that an observation
will fall on a class boundary. Schematically, the class limits and boundaries of
the third class can be shown as follows: - 
Class Boundaries

    

Class Limits

  

57.95 - 58,0 59.9 - 59,95

The class mark
Ali the determinations in each class are represented by a single number; the
Class Mark. It is found by dividing the sum of the limits of a class by 2. Thus for

the first class in table 1.2; (54,0 + 55,9)/2 = 54,95.

The class frequency
The number of observations in each class is found in the third column of table

1.2. '

1.4.2 Relative frequency distributions

The relative frequency of a class is the frequency of the class divided by the
total frequency of all classes. It is generally expressed as a percentage. The 
relative frequency of the class 58,0 - 59,5 in table 1.2 is (14/80)x100 =23,3% .

If the frequencies in a frequency table are replacéd. by the relative frequency,
the resulting table is a relative frequency table.1.4.3 Cumulative frequency distributions
The total frequency of all values less than the upper class boundary of a given
class interval, is called the cumulative frequency up to and including the class

interval. For example: the cumulative frequency up to and including the class
interval 58 - 59,5 is 2 + 8 + 14 = 24, signifying that 24 determinations showed

a copper concentration of 59,95 ppm or less.

1.4.4 The relative cumulative frequency distribution
If the cumulative frequencies are divided by the total frequency and expressed
as a percentage, we obtain the relative cumulative frequency distribution.

1.5 _ Measures of central tendency

1.5.1 The arithmetic mean .
The same definition as in 1.2.3 is used. The X, are (in the case of a frequency

table) taken as the class midpoints. If the class midpoints X,, X;, ..., X, (and thus
the classes themselves) occur f,, f,, .... f, times respectively, the arithmetic

mean is:
LA, * hG* let £. X,

f f

z _ _I»
N

s 2 _

 

Remark:
Since we let a single class midpoint represent all the determinations which are

grouped in that class, we lose information. The arithmetic mean is thus not the
exact mean but an approximation.

1.5.2 The mode w
~ The same definition as for ungrouped data applies. In the case of a frequency

table the mode is approximated as follows:

D,
Mo = L + | -----}]} C

D, + P,
Where L = lower boundary of modal class.
D, = Difference between modal frequency and frequency of class before
modal class

D, = Difference between modal frequency and frequency of the class

after modal class.
C = Class widthThe median 
For grouped data the median is given by

127-4201 c

Me =L +
f . fMef, . | .
where L =_ lower class boundary ofthe median class (i.e. the class containing
the median) :

no - = number of items in the data (i.e. total frequency).
(Zf) ,= the sum of the frequencies before the class which contains the
median.
C _ = the class size.

1. 5 4 Quamles declles and percentiles
The median divides the set of data in two equal parts. in a similar way this set

could be divided in four equal parts called quartiles; Q,, Q,, Q, respectively.
Ten equal parts called deciles denoted by D,, D,,... D, or one hundred equal
parts denoted by f,, f;, .., f,, (percentiles) are also possible.

Note: The median is thus equal to Q, , D, and P3,

To calculate P,, k= 1, 2,..., 99 we generalize. formula (1.6)

__ 1.5.5 The standard deviation

-~ ~- For grouped data the standard deviation is calculated in the same way as for
ungrouped data. The square of each deviation of a class midpoint from the °
mean multiplied by the frequency of that specific class has to be added, divided

by (n - 1) and the square root of the result taken.:

1.86 - Graphs

1.6.1 The histogram Le i

A histogram consists of a set of touching bars, each having its:

(a) - basis on a horizontal axis were the first bar starts at the lowest class
boundary in the frequency table and ends at the upper boundary of the
first class. The subsequent bars all end at the upper boundaries of their
classes, .

(b) _ Area proportional to its class frequency. If the class intervals all have
equal width, the heights of the rectangles are proportional to the class
frequenmes and it is then customary to take the height numerically equal

to the class frequencies. If class intervals do not have equal width, the
heights must be adjusted. ~HISTOGRAM

1.6.2 The frequency polygon .
A frequency polygon is a line graph of class frequency plotted against class

midpoint. It can be obtained by connecting the tops of the rectangles in the
histogram. This graph is used when the underlying data is continuous (like
copper determinations) instead of categorical, the line can than be used for
interpolation. Normally, a frequency polygon curve is closed. To achieve this,
we subtract a class width from the lowest class mark, add a class width to the
highest class mark and plot these points on the X-axis so that we can close the

cLUrVve.

1.6.4 Relative histogram, frequency polygon and ogivé
The same definitions as in 1.6.1, 1.6.2 and 1.6.3 apply, except that the
frequencies are expressed as a percentage of the total.

Remafk:
It is important to note that the total area of the rectangles of the histogram and
the area under the frequency polygon equal 100% in this case.

1.7 _- Relation between mean, median and mode

If the frequency polygon is perfectly symmetrical, the mean, median and mode
coincide. The following figures show the relative positions of these statistics
when the frequency curves have positive and negative skewness.

_ Summary Measures

1.8.1 Interquartile range f
A useful measure of variability is the interquartile range. It represents the middle

50 % of the observations. It the difference between the third quartile and the first

quartile.
It will be noted that P;; = Q, and P;; = Q3. The quantity Q;, - Q, is called the

interquartile Range and gives a measure of the middle 50% of the data. In this
case:

Q, - Q, = 66,95 - 58,66
= 3,29 ppm

1.8.2 Coefficient of variation

by V=4E ..

1.8.4 The box and whisker plot

A graphical representation of the range, the quartiles and their relative positions
with regard to each other can be provided by a box and whisker pict. The plot
begins with a line segment starting at the minimum observed level and ends with
a line segment ending at the maximum value. The box begins at the first quartile
and ends at the third, and is divided at the median. The overall length of the plot
gives the range. The length of the box provides the interquartile range. For the
example above; the box and whisker plot looks as follows:

Box & Whisker Plot

Copper Determinations (p.p.m.)

 

interpretation: The distribution shows a slight negative skew. (The histogram and
polygon confirm this finding). Also, the "box" part of the graph shows that the
interquartile range is quite small compared to the range of the data, this means that
50% of the data is concentrated on a relatively small interval. . 
NB::When the raw data is no longer available the lower boundary of the first class

and the upper boundary of the last class are taken as the box plot's minimum and
maximum respectively.

calculations we treat class limits and borders as the same.

(2) _ Instead of writing a class like "27,5 to under 28,5", a more mathematically
elegant way is to designate this class as "(27,5 - 28,5)", where the "["
bracket indicates that the 27,5 is included, and the ")" bracket indicates

that the 28,5 is excluded in the class.

g/cm"; 4,865] g/cm" , e
In the light of your answers on (d) and (e) above, do you think that the

calculation in (f) can be justified?

By itself, the standard deviation does not convey the relative degree of
variability. For example, consider the mean and standard deviation of the hand

length and reach of men:

Hand length _ Reach

 

u = 18,90 cm - yu = 82,12 cm
0 =0,05 cm o= 0,19 cm

 

The respective standard deviations suggest that reach has about 4 times the
variability of hand length. Find the relative variability by calculating the

coefficient of variation. Comment on your answers.
